# The Plastic World in Black &amp; White

A collection of minimalist 3D animations exploring the poetry of motion through the stark contrast of black and white.

Each scene is a self-contained HTML file using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and runs directly in your browser â€” no backend, no external dependencies.

> ðŸŒ“ *Sometimes, simplicity reveals the most vivid emotions.*

## ðŸŽ¨ Concept

This project is an experiment in:

- **Browser-native simulation**: optimized for mobile and desktop.
- **Code-as-a-toy**: each scene feels like a little digital model kit.
